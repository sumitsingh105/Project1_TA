Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didnt attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.\n\nNow Im seeing in groups that theres an extra benefit being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.\n\nI could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief  grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.\n\n@carlton\n, we request you to kindly consider this matter.

Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marksperhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.\n\nWe sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.\n\nLooking forward to your kind consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHARSH JAYSWAL\n\nHarshjayswal-2003: @s.anand\n \n@carlton\n same happens for me also sir plz look into this matter.\n\n23f2004912: @carlton\n \n@s.anand\n\nThere seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary.

The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.\n\ncarlton: lakshaygarg654:\n\nGA Platform Changes:\n Initially, we were solving questions on \nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n . However, in GA6, we moved to \nSeek\n and in GA7, to \nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh.

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n\n1. Graded Assignments (GA)\n\nGA6 Doubts Unresolved:\n While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. \n(Thread link)\n\nGA Platform Changes:\n Initially, we were solving questions on \nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n . However, in GA6, we moved to \nSeek\n and in GA7, to \nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n2. Project Updates\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\nProject 2:\n There are multiple doubts posted in the \nProject 2\n discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?  \n(thread link)\n\n3. ROE Score Update\n\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLakshay\n\n23f2004912: tigertds\n212148 6.99 KB\n\n@carlton\n Its been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as wellwhen will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.\n\ncarlton: lakshaygarg654:\n\nGA Platform Changes:\n Initially, we were solving questions on \nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n . However, in GA6, we moved to \nSeek\n and in GA7, to \nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh.

However, the reality is that the \ncourse content, assignments, and projects\n have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n \nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\n\nThe \ndifficulty of the projects\n has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to \nrely heavily on peer support\n just to meet the deadlines.

Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\n\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the \ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\n\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this \nDiscourse thread\n where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the \nfirst page of the TDS course\n GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\nHeres students feedback:\n\nIt \nused\n to be an easy course until 2024. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\nNow its hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\nLLMs grade you  unpredictably. \n#\n \n#\n\nThe ROE is hard. \n#\n\nTake Graded assignment 1\n to check if youre ready for this course.\n Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. Itll be too tough for you now.\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - \nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\n\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\nYou \nCAN\n copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\nWhy should you copy?\n Because in real life, theres no time to re-invent the wheel. Youll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. Its important to learn how to do that well.\n\nTo learn well, understand\n what youre copying. If youre short of time, prioritize.\n\nTo learn better, teach\n what youve learnt.\n\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\n\nOnce again Anand has a \nnice blog\n where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\n\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - \nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just tools, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\n The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n\n@22f2001640\n Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldnt be easy.

And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\n\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this \nDiscourse thread\n where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the \nfirst page of the TDS course\n GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\nHeres students feedback:\n\nIt \nused\n to be an easy course until 2024. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\nNow its hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\nLLMs grade you  unpredictably. \n#\n \n#\n\nThe ROE is hard. \n#\n\nTake Graded assignment 1\n to check if youre ready for this course.\n Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. Itll be too tough for you now.\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - \nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\n\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\nYou \nCAN\n copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\nWhy should you copy?\n Because in real life, theres no time to re-invent the wheel. Youll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. Its important to learn how to do that well.\n\nTo learn well, understand\n what youre copying. If youre short of time, prioritize.\n\nTo learn better, teach\n what youve learnt.\n\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\n\nOnce again Anand has a \nnice blog\n where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\n\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - \nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just tools, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\n The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n\n@22f2001640\n Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldnt be easy.

passed\n\nEither the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline.\n\nHow this is beneficial?\n\nAs the GATE exam has now been completed,  we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time\n\nRevision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term\n\nOverall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.\n\nLooking forward to your guidance and kind consideration\n\nRegards\n\nAryan", "meta": {"thread_id": 168310,

passed\n\nEither the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline.\n\nHow this is beneficial?\n\nAs the GATE exam has now been completed,  we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time\n\nRevision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term\n\nOverall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.\n\nLooking forward to your guidance and kind consideration\n\nRegards\n\nAryan\n\nYogesh1: @carlton\n

The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\n\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\n\nKind regards\n\nSakshi6479: sir I am not able to solve these question I have tried all thing also the video which you shared but still after using postman also i am unable to answer it (showing methods not allowed everytime)and also in Q8 I am having this problem\n\nScreenshot 2025-02-05 182750\n19171018 38.3 KB\n\nimport requests\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom sentence_transformers import util\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\nfrom typing import List\n\n# Create FastAPI app\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Enable CORS\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"*\"],  #

I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount.\n\n23f2000573: i think you would have to mail this to the support\n\nTRIGON: @Rrishit\n, please do share the response you receive (or maybe already have) from Support, regarding this, here.\n\n24f2006531: Despite saving multiple times, my score keeps resetting to zero.
