We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment.

The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16.

Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical.

We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\n\n\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\n\n\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\n\n\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nLakshay", "post_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/170147/5", "reply_to": 3, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "thread_context": [{"post_number": 2, "username": "23f2004912", "content": "tigertds\n212×148 6.99 KB\n\n\n@carlton\n It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.", "created_at": "2025-03-17T05:51:22.965Z"}, {"post_number": 3, "username": "carlton", "content": "lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\nGA Platform Changes:\n Initially, we were solving questions on \nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n . However, in GA6, we moved to \nSeek\n and in GA7, to \nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\n\n\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\n\n\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\nProject 1:\n The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\n\n\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\n\n\n3. ROE Score Update\n\n\n\n\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard?

Set an alarm and try it.\n\nAfter the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).\n\nTo check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.\n\n\ninputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')\ntextboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\")\nbuttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\")\ninputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\nbuttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\ntextboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\n\n\n\nDo not submit or save your answers.\n\n\nAll the best!\n\nKind regards\n\nTDS Team\n\n\nUpdate 2\n\n\n26/02/2025 11:00 am\n\n\nWe will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).\n\nThe link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.\n\n\nWe will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTDS Team\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 1\n\n\n25/02/2025 7:46pm\n\n\nWe have now closed the mock submissions.\n\nBoth the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncement\n\n\n25/02/2025\n\n\nThis same information is available in the seek portal as well.\n\n\nThe data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\n\n\nJivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1\n\n\nThe questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6\n\n\nIMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.\n\n\nThe form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.\n\n\nWe have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.\n\n\nWe will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.\n\n\nAll the best!", "created_at": "2025-02-25T13:32:03.835Z"}, {"post_number": 2, "username": "carlton", "content": "", "created_at": "2025-02-25T13:32:15.454Z"}, {"post_number": 3, "username": "22f2001640", "content": "Should we use data mentioned in headline of form or mail data. ?", "created_at": "2025-02-25T13:39:40.411Z"}]}

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\n\n\n\nThe chaos of ROE.\n\n\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\n\n\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\n\n\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\n\n\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\n\n\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\n\n\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\n\n\nHow limited the time is.\n\n\n\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt.

This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\n\n\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the \ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\n\n\n\n\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this \nDiscourse thread\n where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the \nfirst page of the TDS course\n GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\n\nHere’s students’ feedback:\n\n\n\n\nIt \nused\n to be an easy course until 2024. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nNow it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. \n#\n \n#\n \n#\n\n\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably. \n#\n \n#\n\n\nThe ROE is hard. \n#\n\n\n\n\nTake Graded assignment 1\n to check if you’re ready for this course.\n Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - \nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\n\nAgain to quote Anand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\n\nYou \nCAN\n copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n\nWhy should you copy?\n Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\n\n\nTo learn well, understand\n what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\n\n\nTo learn better, teach\n what you’ve learnt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\n\nOnce again Anand has a \nnice blog\n where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\n\n\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n\n\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - \nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\n The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n\n\n@22f2001640\n Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy.

These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\n\n\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\n\n\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\n\n\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\n\n\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\n\n\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\n\n\nThanks for bearing with us.

However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered \n\n\nKind regards,\n\nArnav Mehta\n\n21f3002647", "created_at": "2025-02-18T06:35:49.560Z"}]}

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\n\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\n\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\n\n\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n\n\n\n\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n\n\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\n\n\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n\n\nFor mimicking the testing conditions.

Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\n\n\nHave you watched this session in particular?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\n\n\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\n\n\nKind regards", "post_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/166303/3", "reply_to": 2, "reply_count": 0, "like_count": 0, "thread_context": [{"post_number": 1, "username": "21f3002112", "content": "The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics.

This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsolation\n – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility\n – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortability\n – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\n\n\n\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\n\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n\n\n\n\nUsing requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\n• Best for \nreproducibility\n and \ncollaboration\n since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\n\n\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\n\n• If you \ndon’t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\n\n• If you \ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n\n\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\n\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\n\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\n\n• Using \ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\n\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n\n\nBest Practices Summary\n\n\n\n\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\n\n\nUse a \nrequirements.txt\n file for reproducibility.\n\n\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\n\n\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\n\n\n\n\nKind regards", "post_url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/165922/2", "reply_to": null, "reply_count": 1, "like_count": 0, "thread_context": [{"post_number": 1, "username": "24f2006531", "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries?
