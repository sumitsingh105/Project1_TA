      "Participants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary. From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it.\n\n\nThe other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience.",
      "I also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting.",
      "As my peers said i also feels the same way but i don’t have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey.",
      "well, my choice of dropping might be wrong…but, guided by the following factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recording was perhaps done much earlier as \n@CKPIITM\n pointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would’ve been already recorded.  So, lesser chances to re-record them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no live sessions planned yet for this course… the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it’s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.",
      "Imagine if your reason doesn’t get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don’t think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material.\n\n\n@Anand",
      "CKPIITM:\n\n\n\n\nI know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwasn’t it you who wrote this earlier",
      "But this will not lead me to dropping either. I always find ways to learn. \n I start with expectation and then start my own search for knowledge.",
      "I certainly differ from the point of view of the conversation going on in this thread.\n\nIn my opinion, I am thinking this first week of content as to understand how the problems or objective come from a company which needs these models to implemented. It is more of a professional view rather than a student view. We need to first understand the problem and then start the solution rather than just jumping on to modelling each question.",
      "I also found 1st week content engaging and practical. Maybe I will get few questions wrong,but I feel the concept of discovering the problem was well introduced.",
      "I too find content of week 1 engaging and practical. I agree with \n@anand095\n and \n@akruti\n.",
      "Interesting!  Just this morning, during my morning walk I was thinking how each of us is different in our outlook, our potential, how we realize it, how we’re challenged…and the recent posts show that we indeed are different!  It’s important that none of us stay put on what works for us and what we think is right, but be willing to see the other point of view too…\n\n\nI think I’m starting to understand the other points of view…well I’m trying to",
      "I absolutely see no problem when others find it really engaging, infact they are the bunch of lucky candidate and probably they can help us too in better understanding of some of the confusion which came along with questions.\n\n\nPlz start pouring your understanding of lecture here in brief,  Let’s help each other.",
      "FROM WHERE we can download the PDF or document of the course",
      "Hey guys, thank you everyone for voicing out your opinions and perspective in a healthy manner. I really appreciate it. I understand it might start to sound like greek and latin for some of you, but we intentionally made the decision to have ML foundations as co-requisite. Because you can learn the theory and try to visit back and connect with the practice (tools) part. Some pointers which could be helpful for all of you having different perspectives (both positive and negative) -\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the benefit of this course? - passing this course would definitely make you industry ready. And Anand S, who himself is a very accomplished Data Scientist wanted to give the real flavour of how you would be working in Industry (no spoon-feeding, but giving you directions). Most examinations will be open book, open internet or take home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will share all the resources (codes, excel, etc.). You can download those supplementary materials from the drive link in course contents page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be youtube live sessions every week and the calendar will be shared soon. Please used these live sessions if you need more help or guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the instructors in this course are well accomplished data scientists working in industry and most of them also teach in different IITs/IIMs as faculty. So my humble request is to give them all a bit of respect as some of you are bluntly rude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely this course will be different from other courses because this is going to be an applied course and the idea is to make you know the different quantum of things we could do in data science. I do not think you would be Industry ready unless you get comfortable with this course honestly. Because this is the reality, this is how things are going to be once you interview for or get onboarded as DS.\n\n\nThe materials and case studies are so meticulously curated just for the purpose this course in the past 8 months. They are so valuable and try to explore use the help of live sessions to get your issues sorted out.\n\n\nUse the Youtube live sessions to the fullest those whoever need more help with this course. We would be more than happy to help. Let’s respect each other and that’s a fair expectation I guess. Thanks!",
      "Good evening \n@maheshbalan\n\n\nPoints 2 and 3 in your message will be useful and I look forward to these.\n\n\nI have separately raised another query that some of the tools being used are Gramener products.  Would you kindly assist in letting us know how we can get access to the products so that we can start playing around with them?\n\n\nregards",
      "Thank you for raising this, we will talk to the course faculty and request for access. Thanks",
      "Well, here’s an admission…I stand corrected on my opinion about the TDS course.\n\n\nwith each day watching and learning from the course, I’m absolutely excited to see the content!  It’s presented so well, so well, that I can vouch that I’ve never seen anything like this before…\n\n\nI was totally wrong and wanted to let everyone here know how perspectives can change in a matter of just 2 weeks.\n\n\nHaving said all this, I still believe the first video in this course was misplaced, and that was perhaps a very bad decision by the editors…not the course team.  If my blunt comments hurt anyone, which I’m sure it did, I apologize \n \n@maheshbalan",
      "Hi Anand, thank you for your positive feedback. We have to admit that some of the concerns raised by the students here helped us restructure things efficiently. Thanks for letting us know and please continue to raise concerns if you have any going forward, It will help us fine tune this course further.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMahesh",
      "As things will get structured, and the motive gets  clearer to participant of this course, opinion will change, The video introduction was indeed exciting, but we as participant, who also want to score in assignment and all try to map content with ability to solve the questions and then internally rate as sufficient or insufficient, it is not about how exciting it was rather how helpful it was to score better. We don’t know how industry will judge at first, with marks, excitement, ability to learn new things and many other parameters, so when we watch video we expect it to moving around questions being asked.\n\n\nIt is like we \noverfit ourselves to video content\n, but \nunderfit the assignment content\n. So some \nregularisations\n, you as a team have to add to make it just \nright fit\n.\n\n\nWhether it’s \n@Anand\n or people like me, who themselves are teachers for more than a decade, can see the gap more profound than others and are vocal at the same time.\n\n\nTrust us we are the one who reverses our opinions if things are started to get fine tuned without any hesitation or apprehension.\n\n\nAnd surely, we are not doubting the intent of IITM, they are for sure imparting best of knowledge to mere mortals like us. We are just fortunate in many ways and thankful to IITM.\n\n\nTake our responses just as feedback. And make this course truly world class.",

But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions.
