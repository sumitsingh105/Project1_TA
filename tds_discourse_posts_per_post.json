    "post_content": "Hey guys, thank you everyone for voicing out your opinions and perspective in a healthy manner. I really appreciate it. I understand it might start to sound like greek and latin for some of you, but we intentionally made the decision to have ML foundations as co-requisite. Because you can learn the theory and try to visit back and connect with the practice (tools) part. Some pointers which could be helpful for all of you having different perspectives (both positive and negative) -\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the benefit of this course? - passing this course would definitely make you industry ready. And Anand S, who himself is a very accomplished Data Scientist wanted to give the real flavour of how you would be working in Industry (no spoon-feeding, but giving you directions). Most examinations will be open book, open internet or take home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will share all the resources (codes, excel, etc.). You can download those supplementary materials from the drive link in course contents page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be youtube live sessions every week and the calendar will be shared soon. Please used these live sessions if you need more help or guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the instructors in this course are well accomplished data scientists working in industry and most of them also teach in different IITs/IIMs as faculty. So my humble request is to give them all a bit of respect as some of you are bluntly rude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely this course will be different from other courses because this is going to be an applied course and the idea is to make you know the different quantum of things we could do in data science. I do not think you would be Industry ready unless you get comfortable with this course honestly. Because this is the reality, this is how things are going to be once you interview for or get onboarded as DS.\n\n\nThe materials and case studies are so meticulously curated just for the purpose this course in the past 8 months. They are so valuable and try to explore use the help of live sessions to get your issues sorted out.\n\n\nUse the Youtube live sessions to the fullest those whoever need more help with this course. We would be more than happy to help. Let’s respect each other and that’s a fair expectation I guess. Thanks!",

Would you kindly assist in letting us know how we can get access to the products so that we can start playing around with them?\n\n\nregards",

It’s presented so well, so well, that I can vouch that I’ve never seen anything like this before…\n\n\nI was totally wrong and wanted to let everyone here know how perspectives can change in a matter of just 2 weeks.\n\n\nHaving said all this, I still believe the first video in this course was misplaced, and that was perhaps a very bad decision by the editors…not the course team.  If my blunt comments hurt anyone, which I’m sure it did, I apologize \n \n@maheshbalan",

    "post_content": "As things will get structured, and the motive gets  clearer to participant of this course, opinion will change, The video introduction was indeed exciting, but we as participant, who also want to score in assignment and all try to map content with ability to solve the questions and then internally rate as sufficient or insufficient, it is not about how exciting it was rather how helpful it was to score better. We don’t know how industry will judge at first, with marks, excitement, ability to learn new things and many other parameters, so when we watch video we expect it to moving around questions being asked.\n\n\nIt is like we \noverfit ourselves to video content\n, but \nunderfit the assignment content\n. So some \nregularisations\n, you as a team have to add to make it just \nright fit\n.\n\n\nWhether it’s \n@Anand\n or people like me, who themselves are teachers for more than a decade, can see the gap more profound than others and are vocal at the same time.\n\n\nTrust us we are the one who reverses our opinions if things are started to get fine tuned without any hesitation or apprehension.\n\n\nAnd surely, we are not doubting the intent of IITM, they are for sure imparting best of knowledge to mere mortals like us. We are just fortunate in many ways and thankful to IITM.\n\n\nTake our responses just as feedback. And make this course truly world class.",

And I found it very hard to follow a lot of concepts.  But now (I’ve taken MLP course for this term),  I’m able to appreciate and understand the content better. Because now I have a basic understanding of different Machine Learning Models and I know where to apply what.\n\n\nFor example in TDS course week 5, we were taught about Pycaret, KMeans clustering and image classification. A lot of it went above my head because I didn’t know what RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression or KMeans Classifier was.\n\n\nI wish I had taken TDS after completing all ML courses. It would have helped me to understand a lot of DS tools better.",

There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.\n\n\nKind regards",
